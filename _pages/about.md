Welcome to my page, I'm Nanne and I develop mostly in Java and in the area of security where development touches security.
In my spare time I'm one of the project leaders of the [OWASP WebGoat project](https://webgoat.github.io/WebGoat/) and
maintain a couple of open source projects.

Currently I work as a software developer at [Xebia](https://xebia.com).
