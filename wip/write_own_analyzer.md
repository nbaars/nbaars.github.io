title: Write your own Java analyzer
categories: [Java]

With the rise of all the micro-services we find ourselves with multiple code bases. Pulling information out of these
repositories might be a daunting task. Shell scripts with `find`, `grep` etc will only take you that far.
Let's look at something more powerful where we can easily write a small analysis tool ourselves to parse some 
Java code. In this blog let's try to write a small analyzer to find a real issue in your source code.

# Introduction

# Multiple parsers

JavaParser
Spoon
Eclipse JDT
Java compiler extensions

# Write an analyzer

Path Iterables thingy

# Lombok

# Writing a Maven plugin
